### Hi there 👋

I’m Victor Nwakpa from Ebonyi, Nigeria.

I love creating solutions with the aid of the internet. I am a student at Ebonyi State University, studying Computer science. I love tweaking stuff I see on the internet and creating them into my idea. Solving problem with tech is something I have always dreamed of.  My superpower is not only solving problems with tech but also helping others come to a great stature in their tech journey.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🔭 I’m currently training at Alx_africa as a software engineer
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with Management
