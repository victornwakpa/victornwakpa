### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m Victor Nwakpa from Ebonyi, Nigeria.

I love creating solutions with the aid of the internet. I am a student at Ebonyi State University, studying Computer science. I love tweaking stuff I see on the internet and creating them into my idea. Solving problem with tech is something I have always dreamed of.  My superpower is not solving problems with tech but also helping others come to a great stature in their tech journey.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my lifestyle
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Golang
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on ...
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with Cloud Computing
